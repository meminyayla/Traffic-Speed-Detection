# Traffic-Speed-Detection 

Detection of veichles with computer vision only.

## Video

Any Similar Video would do, however there would be some changes you'll have to make to the code if you choose a different video. This is due to a change of scene, distance estimation and pixel clarity.

For SpeedRadar.py, the region of interest, the red timer lines and the area threshold used for detecting vehicles.

For Tracker.py, the numbers given in the update() function and getsp() fuction would change for a different video.
